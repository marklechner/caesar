# Caesar cypher

## What is this?
Course material for the 2 week session for hacker-school.de in Berlin to teach kids how to code in Python: https://tickets.hacker-school.de/ON168-Pyth/

## What are we building?
A simple script that encrypts or decrypts provided text with the classic Caesar Cypher

## How will build this?
* The goal of this course is to walk kids through the basics of programming using Python
* Each module will give the attendee one pice of the puzzle, so at the end it can be piced together

## Why this Caesar thing?
* It's a nice and easy way to get the basic concepts of cryptography by looking at key, algorythm, cipher text and so on
* It's also a great historical refernce how such a simple algorythm was used in ancient Roman times to ensure safe transmission of critical messages through untrusted territories, kind of analogous how communicating over public internet works nowdays

## What tools to use 
The entire excersise can be done via www.repl.it. Just sign up for a free account and follow along with the modules, which each has a README.MD to explain the concepts
